_WIP_

This is the documentation about How bdsx works for 3rd developers who want to make an update.

All example codes or file paths specified in this document are written based on [96eb05d](https://github.com/bdsx/bdsx/tree/96eb05dbb0c2968f84ad172a0cc8ccdd7a5e1f8c). file names are same with bdsx repository, but the line numbers are relative value. _I never mention this again from now._
